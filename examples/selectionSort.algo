* Selection Sort in Pseudo code
*

given: 
  a ... array of integer
  n ... length of a
  i,j ... index variables
  t ... index variable

selectionSort:
  for each i from 1 to n-1
     t := i
     for each j from i+1 to n
        if a[j] < a[t] then
           t := j
     swap t and i in a

post conditions:
  for all applicable i: a[i] < a[i+1]
  a is a permutation of original a
