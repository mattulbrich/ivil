  <h1>Java implementation and specification</h1> 

  <p>The first challenge from the Verified Software Competition
      (VSComp) at VSTTE'10, organised by Peter Mueller and Natarajan
      Shankar:</p>

  <p>Given an N-element array of natural numbers, write a program to
      compute the sum and the maximum of the elements in the
      array.</p>

  <p>The specification is given as comment annotations to a java
      program. These specifications are added to the translation of
      the Java byte code to create the compound proof obligation.</p>
