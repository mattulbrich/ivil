  This package contains the classes {@link de.uka.iti.pseudo.proof.Proof} and {@link de.uka.iti.pseudo.ProofNode}
  that are used to represent proof trees. {@link de.uka.iti.pseudo.proof.RuleApplication}s are used to denote
  applications of rules in certain situations.
  
  <p>
  This package has some package private methods which are, e.g. shared between <tt>Proof</tt> and 
  <tt>ProofNode</tt>. The publicly available interface is available from Proof rather than from ProofNode.
  The latter has only public getter methods, no setter methods.
  
  <p>Proof is thread-safe because of a locking mechanism (see {@link de.uka.iti.pseudo.proof.Proof}).
  
  <p>RuleApplication can be immutable or mutable. An immutable copy is made when a rule application is
  to be stored in a proof node.
