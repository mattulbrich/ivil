(*
 * This rule can -- in combination with the where condition axiom
 * be used to add axioms from the environment to the sequent.
 * When this rule is to be applied, the property "axiomName" has
 * to be set on the RuleApplication to the name of the axiom to
 * add. %b is then instantiated accordingly by the where condition.
