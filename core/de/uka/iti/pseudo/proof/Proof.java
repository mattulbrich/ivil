/**
 * A proof contains the information on a tree of sequents and their meta
 * information.
 * 
 * It is a mutable object, i.e., the application of inference rules does not
 * result in a different new proof value, but changes the data structures within
 * this object.
 * 
 * <h2>Locking</h2>
 * 
 * The lock to be used with this object can be obtained using the method
 * {@link #getLock()}. If you intend to do several operations on the proof, take
 * the lock, do your actions and then release it. A typical piece of code would look like:
 * <pre>
 *   Proof p; // ...
 *   
 *   Lock lock = p.getLock();
 *   lock.lock();
 *   try {
 *      RuleApplication ruleApp1; // ... calculate it
 *      RuleApplication ruleApp2; // ... calculate it
 *   
 *      p.apply(ruleApp1);
 *      p.apply(ruleApp2)
 *   } finally {
 *      lock.unlock();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * You can also use {@link Lock#tryLock()} and fail in case the lock cannot be acquired.
 * 
 * <h2>Observable</h2>
 * 
 * All observers which intend to follow changes on this object will receive
 * calls of {@link Observer#update(Observable, Object)} with two kinds of
 * arguments:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Either with a proof node as argument. It is then a node whose set of
 * children has changed recently.
 * <li>Or with an argument of <code>null</code> indicating the some nodes on the
 * tree may have changed.</li>
 * </ol>
