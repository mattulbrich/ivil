This presents a small overview of tags. It might be a good idea to write a nicer
 documentation some day.


dragdrop
========

Purpose:
 Tells the GUI, that this rule can be used using drag and drop gestures.

Argument:
 Digit from 0 to 9 which the discribes how "interesting" it will be to the user
 to chose this application over others. There is an option that will make the 
 user chose the rule with the highest number be chosen automatically.
 
Restrictions:
 This tag can only be used if the rule has exactly one interact where condition
 or, if it has no interact condition, it has exactly one assume statement.
 This is because only one term can be transfered using drag and drop.
 
 
hiding
======

Purpose:
 States, that the Argument terms were hidden and might be interesting later.
 
Argument:
 List of locations seperated by ','. Locations can be either 'find', to match 
 the find clause, or 'a%i' where %i is the i'th assume statement. As there is
 at the moment writing no mechanism to hide other terms then the find clause,
 only the find mechanism is encouraged to be used.
 
Restrictions:
 The hidden terms have to be toplevel terms, as other terms can generally not be
 reintroduced to the sequent.
