 <h2>Proof hint <code>rule</code></h2>

 In order to perform a certain rule on a branch, this hint can be used.

 <h3>Arguments</h3>

 assert emptyset &lt;: SetM ; "use the lemma §(rule emptyset_lemma)"

 <h2>Proof hint <code>expand</code></h2>

 In order to expand a recursive definition on a branch, this hint can be used.
 You can specify how many times a definition is to be unrolled.

 <h3>Arguments</h3> cut takes one argument which is the name of the rule to be
 applied.
 <p>
 An optional second argument specifies the number of times the definition is
 to be unrolled.

 <h3>Example</h3>

 If there is a rule which defines the recursive function <tt>int f(int)</tt>:
 <pre>
 rule f_def
   find f(%x)
   replace 1+f(%x-1)
 </pre>

 A hint <tt>§(expand f_def)</tt> would render a formula <tt>f(2)</tt> to

      <![CDATA[

 <h2>Proof hint <code>pick</code></h2>

 This hint allows you to remove formulas from a sequent and to pick

 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 Takes one or more sequent formula locators which match the regular expression
 <tt>(S|A).[0-9]+</tt>. <tt>A</tt> denoting antecedent and <tt>S</tt> succedent.
 The number means the number of the formula on the sequent (0 is first).

 <p> Formulas are removed using the <tt>hide_left</tt> and <tt>hide_right</tt>
 rules.

 <h3>Example</h3>
 Assume there is a larger complex sequent which looks like
 <center>
    {@code x >= 0, y >= 0, ... |- ...}
 </center>
 and that it helps the verification process to know that {@code x*y >= 0}.
 The decision procedure, however, is distracted by the remainder of the sequent.
 Hence we can guide it from within the program by adding
 <pre>
 {@code assert x*y >= 0 ; "first two imply goal §(pick A0 A1 S0)"}

      <![CDATA[

 <h1>Where conditions</h1>

 Where conditions are used to formulate constraints von schema instantiations
 in rule definitions. They describe conditions on the matched terms under
 which the rule may be applied.

 <p>
 Where conditions can take arguments, but do not have to. For some conditions,
 <i>marker arguments</i> (schema variables with special names) can be used to
 specify a particular behaviour of a condition.

 <h3>Example</h3>

 The where condition<br/>
 <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where intLiteral %a</tt><br/>

 in a rule makes the rule only applicable if the schema variable %a is
 instantiated with an integer literal.

 <h2>Active where conditions</h2>

 Where conditions cannot only check the instantiation context but also act and
 actively modify it.

 <p>
 An active where condition can add new schema instantiations to the context.
 Existing schema instantiations will not be changed, only new entries added.
 Please note that active conditions can also fail and not accept an
 instantiation.

 <p>
 The documentation will point out which parameters are active, and which are
 passive. Future syntax changes may make the distinction clearer.

 <h3>Example</h3>

 The where condition<br/>
 <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freshVar %z, %condition</tt><br/>

 instantiates <code>%z</code> with a variable of the same type which does not
 appear (bound or unbound) in the instantiation of <code>%condition</code>.]]>

 <h2>Where condition <tt>toplevel</tt></h2>

 <h2>Where condition <tt>freshVar</tt></h2>

 This condition can be used to ensure that a variable does not occur free nor

 This is an example of an <em>active</em> condition since it may add variable
 instantiations. If the first formal parameter is a schema variable, it

 The resulting variable is named after the first parameter to the condition,

 This condition can also be used to check whether a variable does not appear
 freely in a term. See second Example

 <h3>Syntax</h3> The where condition expects a first parameter which can
 either be a variable or a schema variable. Any number of arbitrary terms may
 follow.

 <h3>Example:</h3>

 <h2>Meta function <tt>$$skolem</tt></h2>

 This meta function can be used to create a new skolem symbol. Since ivil does
 not support free variables (unbound) every skolem symbol is nullary function
 symbol.

 <h3>Syntax</h3>

 The meta function takes one argument of arbitrary type and returns a term of
 the same type. If applied twice or more often to the same term, it results in
 the same term. This term is new constant symbol which has not yet occurred in
 the proof.

 <h3>Example:</h3>

 <pre>
 rule forall_right
   find  |-  (\forall %x; %b)
   replace  $$subst(%x, $$skolem(%x), %b)
 </pre>
