/**
 * This class implements an object pool similar to the mechanism used in
 * {@link String#intern()}.
 *
 * It helps ensuring that for immutable objects only one object is created and
 * kept in memory.
 *
 * <p>
 * Typical usage looks like:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class Immutable {
 *     Immutable(X x) { ... }
 *
 *     public boolean equals(Object o) { ... }
 *
 *     public int hashCode() { ... }
 * }
 *
 * class ImmutableFactory {
 *     ObjectCachePool pool = new ObjectCachePool();
 *
 *     Immutable make(X x) {
 *         return pool.cache(new Immutable(x));
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Please note that cached objects <b>must</b> override the methods
 * {@link Object#equals(Object)} and {@link Object#hashCode()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Internally a {@link ConcurrentSoftHashCacheImpl} is used. If the runtime
 * environment does no longer contain a reference to a representative, it is
 * removed from the cache. The cache does, hence, not keep unneeded objects.
 *
 * <p>
 * The map is synchronised and thread-safe.
